## Beaglebone Temperature Logger

This is a bit of python code that uses the
[Adafruit Python IO library](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python)
to read the temperature and pressure from
[TMP102]http://www.ti.com/product/tmp102)( (temperature) and
[BMP085](http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/en/homepage/products_3/environmental_sensors_1/bmp085_1/bmp085)
(Pressure) I2C sensors. Both sensors were purchased assembled from
[Sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com). They're a good company!
